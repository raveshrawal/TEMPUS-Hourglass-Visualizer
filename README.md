🚀 **Live Demo:**  
👉 https://raveshrawal.github.io/Hourglass-Problem-Visualizer/
The **Hourglass Puzzle Visualizer** is an interactive web application that helps you solve classic **hourglass timing problems** using visual simulation.

This project is inspired by well-known logical puzzles such as:

👉 *“How can you measure exactly 9 minutes using a 7-minute and a 4-minute hourglass?”*

These puzzles are widely used in **technical interviews, aptitude tests, and logical reasoning challenges** to evaluate problem-solving skills. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

This tool allows you to simulate, experiment, and visualize different timing strategies in real-time.
## 🧠 The Hourglass Puzzle

You are given two hourglasses:
- ⏳ 7-minute timer
- ⏳ 4-minute timer

Goal:
Measure exactly **9 minutes**

### Solution Idea

1. Start both hourglasses
2. After 4 minutes, flip the 4-minute glass
3. After 7 minutes, flip the 7-minute glass
4. Continue flipping strategically to reach exactly 9 minutes

This problem demonstrates how **time intervals can be combined and manipulated** to achieve precise measurements. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
